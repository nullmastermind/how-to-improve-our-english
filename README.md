# How to improve your English - Tips and Tricks

Hey folks.

In my first article in English, and I would like to write some ways I use to improve my English.
So, itÂ´s essential to think about the change our mindset about English. In my case, I had a blocked with English and to be honest, I always feel fear because of people still sad to me "You need obligatory to learn English, or you do not should success in your professional life!" and some words like "obligation" do not help to improve nothing.
So, after many courses, I decided to move me and start to use the language day by day, and I talked with my friends of speaking English very well and take some ideas to apply in my life. Follow the insights.

1. **Change the language in your all types of equipment (cell phones, computer, tablets, all kind of applications)  from Portuguese to English (American or British), and you need to get used to every day in English**

	When we use these things in English, our brain start to change the idea of reading all things in Portuguese and begin to think in English, for example, we do not understand "Segunda Feira, 14 de Janeiro" and now, we read "Monday, 14 January." and some other stuff.

2. **Use Kindle to read your favourite books in English**

	Is it possible to buy some dictionaries in English and configure it, so, it is crucial because we mark some if you do not know and the kindle show you the meaning, how to say, and you need to write "Vocabulary". 
  
	Take these notes at the end the day and find some synonyms to improve your vocabulary and try to say the word and the synonyms and take notes (yes, it is essential to write in a notebook or piece of paper).
  
	Keep calm when you start to read in English because at first is slower your read because your brain is not prepared to learn in other languages right?
  
	Take the habit to read in English every day to training your brain. Start with your favourite histories or, in our case, with QA books and this makes it easier to understand some contexts.

3. **Watch Kids movies** 

	Yes, you hear right, kids movies are excellent to improve our English because the language is just for kids, so, the children do not have the brain prepared to understand the Lord of the Rings lol, but, ready to hear other children talk and this case, we are like as children and do not have a rich vocabulary.
  
	Do not forget to watch with English subtitles right!

4. **Use Grammarly**

	Do you know Grammarly? 
  
    Well, Grammarly is an application to help write correctly (right now during this article, I used lol). In my case, I have Premium access, and I pay 25 dollars per month, and I have some things like a personal dashboard and know how many sentences I wrong during the text. The statistic about how many penalties I wrong every word numbers (example, I have three errors every 100 words) and show me what kind of mistakes I make (prepositions, lack of synonyms,  how many unique words I used, etc.). Follow the  [Grammarly website:](https://www.grammarly.com/about).

5. **Start to write in English in meetings**

	Yes I know, is too difficult to talk in Portuguese and write in English, but, you need to create the habit to think in English some things.
	Is probably you get lost in a meeting because you need to understand in Portuguese and think in English and write in English, so, keep calm and go.
	For testers, start to write your test cases and gherkins in English and show to other your annotations and take feedback about that (remember, just Americans and British and Australian are fluent in English right).
